Include a README.txt describing what you learned from this assignment about the differences between C++ and Ruby. 
In your README.txt file, describe how your generated EWE code works for Multiply, Divide, Store, Recall, and Input 
(just the ones you completed).

Some of the differences that I noticed between C++ and Ruby is the static and dynamic typing that these languages have.
C++ being statically typed is something that I took advantage of when writing code, as I could hover over a variable and have VSCode
tell me the type of it inline. Ruby didn't have anything as nice as this, but it has a different feature where you don't have to declare
a type for variables at all. Since it is dynamically typed I can write a line such as f = Factor() and not worry about the type of f, I
can just use it and see run time errors when you run the calccomp.
